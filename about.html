## About

I am Sai Adarsh, pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Carolina - Columbia and will be graduating in MAY 2019. With an experience of over 3 years in the field, I offer a strong foundation in software development, programming principles across web and application, I love challenges in developing efficient data structures.

I am ever on the lookout for fresh challenges. Being adaptable to any situation is my forte. I manage time efficiently. I always brainstorm on any problem I stumble upon in my path. I am a team player, looking to interact with people both professionally as well as personally. In an age where people long for more human connections amidst the din and cry of the fast-paced world, I present a balanced mix of professional and human work ethic. Eager to gather knowledge on varied subjects, I can bring to the table the zeal and zest of a teenager, mingled with the maturity of a researcher. I look forward to growing as an individual at every step, gaining experience and ultimately helping an organization move to greater heights.
