## About

I am Sai Adarsh, Graduated from University of South Carolina - Columbia, graduated on May 2019. Currently working as a Software Enginner for Goldman Sachs starting November 2019.

I have overall experience of over 4.5 years in the software industry, I offer a strong foundation in software development, programming principles across web and application.

I always look for fresh challenges and being adaptable to any situation is my forte. I manage time efficiently. I always brainstorm on any problem I stumble upon in my path. I am a team player, looking to interact with people both professionally as well as personally. In an age where people long for more human connections amidst the din and cry of the fast-paced world, I present a balanced mix of professional and human work ethic. Eager to gather knowledge on varied subjects, I can bring to the table the zeal and zest of a teenager, mingled with the maturity of a researcher. I look forward to growing as an individual at every step, gaining experience and ultimately helping an organization move to greater heights.
