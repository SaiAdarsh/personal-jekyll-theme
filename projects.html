##PROJECTS



Real Time sentiment analysis on Twitter: R<br>
• Developed an application containing Machine Learning algorithms (Kmeans) for analyzing tweets and checking similarity
among them using clustering approach and decide the best performance Algorithm based on training and testing model.
Library Management System: JAVA, JAVA SWING, JDBC, MySQL <br>
• Project involves creation of database host application that interfaces with a backend SQL database implementing a Library
Management System. Users of this system are understood to be librarians.
Files and Indexing: JAVA, SQL <br>
• Goal of this project is to build a rudimentary database engine that is loosely based on MySQL utilizing indexing techniques,
which is called SQL Lite.Driven Data Competition - Data Mining the water Table: R <br>
• Predicted the status of water pumps in Tanzania (Country in East Africa), utilizing ensemble, supervised and unsupervised
Machine Learning techniques and decided the accuracy of algorithm using 10-fold cross validation
Image Dehazing using Multi Scale Fusion: Matlab <br>
• Designed a project to remove Haze and Fog caused by severe weather conditions with the emphasis on making scsenes more
visible. The project has been implemented with Gaussian pyramid, Laplacian pyramid filters and simulated using MATLAB.
